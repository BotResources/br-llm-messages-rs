# Changelog

All notable changes to `br-llm-messages` are documented here. A single git tag
`v{version}` releases the crate. Format follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/); versions follow semver.
Release headings are plain `## X.Y.Z` — the release pipeline greps that exact
form to decide whether a version ships.

## Unreleased

### Added

- Repository scaffold: crate manifest at `0.0.0`, governance files (LICENSE,
  CONTRIBUTING, SECURITY, SUPPORT, PR template, issue-template config),
  `.gitignore`, and `deny.toml`.
- CI (`ci.yml`): fmt + clippy + test, MSRV 1.89 build, `cargo-deny`,
  `cargo-machete`, `cargo semver-checks`, changelog + README-pin check,
  shellcheck, and trufflehog secret scan.
- CD (`release-tags.yml`): auto-tag and release the crate version on merge to
  `main`, inert while the version is the `0.0.0` scaffold.

No model code.
